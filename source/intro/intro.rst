What is hoclights
=================

Hoclights is a progressive web-app (`PWA <https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/>`_) to control smart objects that are present in `HOC <http://hoc.elet.polimi.it/hoc/>`_ - Hypermedia Open Center laboratory and `i3lab <http://i3lab.polimi.it>`_ - Innovative Interactive Interfaces laboratory.


Purpose
-------

The purpose of hoclights software is to experiment with smart connected objects and the way to enhance their capabilities by controling them through pervasive interfaces (e.g. web-apps).

Hoclights was built with smart lights in mind. However it is flexible enough to control any smart object following a custom protocol specification.

.. warning:: the custom protocol specification used in hoclights is not documented yet.
